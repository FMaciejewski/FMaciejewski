## Hello World ðŸ‘‹
I'm a technical school student from Poland. I'm eager to learn something new, that's why I started to get into GitHub and Git. I find myself most confindent in writing in SQL, but I also learn C# as well as web desing. Currently I'm working with my friends making repositories with our school projects on ..........

Besides programming I like going to the gym, volleyball and all kinds of mountains activities. It's a really good feeling to take a break from everything once in a while and connect with nature.
